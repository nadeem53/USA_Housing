# Data Science Project on Kaggle Data
This repository contains data from the Kaggle [USA_Housing] dataset, which has been cleaned, visualized, analyzed, and used to train an ML model.

Steps
# The following steps were taken to complete this project:

Data was downloaded from the Kaggle dataset.

Data was cleaned to remove any errors or inconsistencies.

Data was visualized to identify trends and patterns.

Data was analyzed using statistical methods.

An ML model was trained on the data.

This project demonstrates the ability to clean, visualize, analyze, and model data from Kaggle. The results of this project can be used to [list of potential uses].

Usage
To use the data and ML model in this repository, simply clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Then, you can run the following scripts:

clean_data.py: This script cleans the data.

visualize_data.py: This script visualizes the data.

analyze_data.py: This script analyzes the data.

train_model.py: This script trains the ML model.

Once the ML model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data. 

To do this, simply run the following script:

predict.py: This script takes new data as input and outputs predictions from the ML model.
